"""Derived unreachable-task projection (#3452).

A task whose dependency ended without delivering can never become claimable,
but nothing in the record used to say so: the dependent kept its ``OPEN``
status and was pushed back onto the claim heap every tick. This module is the
predicate that answers "which tasks could never have run, and because of
what", computed from the recorded task graph alone.

Everything here is pure. The same task set produces the same answer in the
same order regardless of insertion order, so two operators reading the same
journal derive an identical set and can compare them directly.

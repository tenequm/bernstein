#   TOOL  < SIBLING  < SESSION
#
# * TOOL   - a single tool invocation is aborted; the agent session continues.

# * SIBLING - sibling agents (same parent) receive SHUTDOWN; the parent and
#             this session are unaffected unless policy escalates further.
# * SESSION - the full agent session is torn down and SHUTDOWN cascades to
#             all descendants via ``propagate_abort``.
#
# Escalation between levels is opt-in via ``AbortPolicy``.  By default each
# level contains its failure and does not propagate upward.

    """Probe a clean-but-fast agent exit and surface full diagnostic detail.

    Historically a very-short-lived agent that exited cleanly (code 0, no
    files modified, no commits, no completion signals) was accepted as
    "no changes needed" with nothing more than a WARNING log line, and
    callers downstream only ever saw a bare ``bool`` verdict - there was no
    way to report or act on *why* the exit looked suspicious. Ground truth:
    run-9 attempt-7's manager exited 0 after ~3s with zero tools and zero
    child tasks, the orphan handler auto-completed the task, and the run
    then declared itself healthy (see
    work/agent-reports/2026-07-02-run9-attempt9-audit.md).

    This probe is unconditional for every clean exit (not just ones under
    the threshold) so the caller always has the full structured record;
    ``suspicious`` tells the caller whether the runtime crossed
    ``_FAST_EXIT_THRESHOLD_S``. Never truncates/swallows anything: the
    exit code, a manifest path (when a runner manifest was preserved), and
    the last ``_FAST_EXIT_LOG_TAIL_LINES`` lines of the agent's log are all
    returned in full and logged at ERROR when suspicious.

    Args:
        orch: Orchestrator instance.
        session: The dead agent's session (exit_code, spawn_ts, id must be set).
        task_id: The orphaned task this exit is being evaluated for.

    Returns:
        A dict (never a bare bool) with keys: ``suspicious`` (bool),
        ``runtime_s`` (float), ``exit_code`` (int | None), ``manifest_path``
        (str | None), ``log_path`` (str | None), ``log_tail`` (list[str]),
        ``session_id`` (str), ``task_id`` (str), ``tokens_used`` (int) and
        ``no_session_activity`` (bool).

        ``no_session_activity`` is the transport-failure signal: the agent
        exited without consuming a single token, so it never exchanged
        anything with the model. That is a different fault from an agent that
        ran, spent tokens and produced nothing, and it needs a different
        response - retrying a transport failure is reasonable, while retrying
        a genuinely empty deliverable just burns the budget again.

    A live PID and the heartbeat protocol JSON are real evidence of progress and
    refresh the heartbeat unconditionally. The plain agent log is not: most
    adapters merge stderr into it via ``stderr=subprocess.STDOUT``, so a
    provider retry loop, a progress spinner, or a deprecation warning moves
    its mtime with no task progress behind it. Left unbounded, that alone
    can sustain the heartbeat indefinitely, defeating both the
    heartbeat-timeout reap and the wall-clock timeout's own extension logic
    in ``reap_dead_agents``. So a heartbeat refreshed from the log (or the
    worktree ``.git`` pointer) alone is capped to a bounded number of
    consecutive ticks before an unconfirmed session is left to age out.

    ``session.pid`` is ``int | None``: a session handed to a remote runtime
    bridge is transitioned to "working" with no local PID at all. Those
    sessions skip the liveness probe and are judged from their file signals,
    the same way ``_probe_liveness_signals`` guards its own probe.

    The log and ``.git`` paths are resolved through the shared
    :func:`_resolve_agent_log_path` / :func:`_resolve_agent_worktree_dir`
    helpers, the same way the sibling probe :func:`_probe_liveness_signals`
    does, rather than hardcoding the legacy ``.sdd/worktrees/<id>/`` layout.
    Hardcoding it left every other layout this codebase writes agent logs
    into with no log signal at all: the current default worktree layout
    (``.sdd/runtime/worktrees/<id>/``), the worktrees-disabled root log, and
    any spawn path that reports its own ``session.log_path`` - the remote
    runtime bridge, container, and sandbox-session paths all log to
    ``<spawn_cwd>/.sdd/logs/<id>.log``. A bridge-backed session felt that
    worst: it also has ``pid=None`` (no local process to probe) and gets no
    heartbeat protocol JSON, since ``bernstein.bridges`` never writes one and
    the single pre-spawn touch in ``spawner_core`` is never refreshed. With
    all three signals blind it aged out at ``heartbeat_timeout_s`` however
    healthy the remote run was.

#
# The canonical implementation lives in
# :mod:`bernstein.core.agents.agent_recycling`.  Its symbols are re-exported
# from the bottom of this module (see the ``from agent_recycling import ...``
# block at EOF) so existing importers of ``bernstein.core.agent_lifecycle``
# continue to work while the constants and algorithm have a single source
# of truth. This closes - previously ``_detect_idle_reason`` and
# its four ``_IDLE_*`` thresholds existed in parallel copies that could
# (and did) silently diverge when one was tuned and the other was not.
#
# The import lives at EOF because ``agent_recycling`` pulls in
# ``agent_reaping``, which imports several helpers defined later in *this*
# module; deferring the import until after those definitions avoids the
# circular-import failure.
